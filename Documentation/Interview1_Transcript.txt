Dear <Student>,

Here are the project details below:

Project
Creating an online blog/news website that acts as a repository for student articles and a homepage for student groups (HSSC). This will allow student articles to be digitised. It will be a high traffic platform.

It should contain:
- a blog system that can be regularly and easily updated to allow for upload of articles
- a user-friendly interface and layout
- general website elements such as 'about us' etc.

It should look something like this: https://hkisjunto.org/
or this: https://www.therchktruth.org/

Best regards,
<Client>

Dear <Client>,

To accommodate the 'high traffic', I feel it is appropriate to use a third-party hosting provider. I plan on using Github Pages, such that the website URL would be hsscstc.github.io. Should you have the budget, it may also be viable to purchase a custom domain name.

Here is my proposed plan:
- I shall design a website with a design inspired by the websites you have given.
- I shall then design an application which allows you to create, edit and manage blog posts for your organisation.
- Every time you want to update the website, you will 'export' the website from the application. The application will (re)build the whole website with all the custom styles I have created such that it can be uploaded directly to the host.
- This is to remove the need for costly infrastructure such as servers and databases, since the built website is technically a static website but functions like a dynamic site.
A few things to note:
- After consulting some of your organisation's members, I have decided that the header and title fonts will be Couture, and Acumin will be the body font.

Please confirm that this is suitable for you and I will begin with the development of the solution.
