                                            <p><span style="font-size: 20px; ">Imagine being forced to choose a restaurant when you have absolutely no preference; when you’re physically unfit to decide; or even when your other beliefs contradict with you having to make an opinion- it’s inefficient, and quite a nuisance to say the least. Compulsory voting is the same thing: a grey-area infringement on basic rights, an impractical solution, and perhaps to some extent even an undermining of the legal system. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px; ">It is commonly accepted that the inherent principles of the law are establishing standards, maintaining order, resolving disputes, and protecting rights. Compulsory voting can be seen to adhere to these functions in that it establishes a standard for voter turnout in elections. However, it can also be seen as a violation of the latter objective through it’s arguable infringement upon freedom of speech.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px; ">In most Western nations, including the United Kingdom, citizens have a positive and negative right to freedom of speech: meaning that they have both rights of expression and rights or inexpression. As voting constitutes as an expression of opinion, the implementation of compulsory voting would lead to citizens being legally binded to express their opinions- hence violating these rights. Furthermore, another basic right that is afforded by individuals is their freedom to religion. Though the percentage of population by which this is applicable to is small, it nevertheless is still a contradiction. Some denominations, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses and Christadelphians, have openly committed to maintaining political neutrality. With the implementation of this law, such individuals must contravene against their religion, consequently restricting their freedom to faith. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px; ">Of course, citizens could submit protest (one’s that don’t count) or donkey (randomly selected) ballots. Currently, in the 10 countries where compulsory voting laws are enforced, 9 of them -with the exception of DPRK- allow the submitting of declined ballots. However, as these ballots are completely redundant, decreeing for such individuals to vote is a waste of resources. On the other hand, donkey votes perhaps pose even greater detriment. As the purpose of an election is to gain general consensus regarding the preferences of a population, random voting undermines this and lead to a misrepresentation of public interests. This has posed as an issue in Australia, where Compulsory Voting is enforced, with an estimation of a significant 13% increased voting for a party during a long-list election. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px; ">Finally, some individuals -such as the mentally ill- are simply incapable of voting and must be exempt from this law. To have them suffer consequences for a deed they cannot perform would be unfair. But, at the same time, to collate a list of individuals and their justification for not voting would be expensive, posing opportunity costs for revenue that could be better spent on merit activities such as education. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px; ">In conclusion, this law sacrifices many costs, such as the infringement of rights and impractical implementation, to endure only one true benefit of high voter turnout. Countries should not implement this unless out of desperate necessity to mitigate an extremely low voter turnout, and even if they do so, they must identify easy and low-cost methods for individuals to exempt. </span></p>
